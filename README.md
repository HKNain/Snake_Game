# Snake Game

A classic Snake game implemented in C# using Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF). This project provides a fun and interactive experience of the nostalgic Snake game while showcasing the use of WPF for building desktop applications.

## Features

- **Single-player Mode**: Control the snake to collect food and grow.
- **Intuitive User Interface**: Clean and easy-to-use WPF interface.
- **Real-time Gameplay**: Responsive controls and smooth animations.
- **Score Tracking**: Displays the current score as the game progresses.
- **Game Over Detection**: Automatically ends the game if the snake collides with itself or the boundaries.
- **Replay Option**: Restart the game without closing the application.

## Technologies Used

- **Language**: C#
- **Framework**: Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF)

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/snake-game-wpf.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

   ```bash

## How to Play

1. Use the arrow keys to control the snake's direction:

   - Up, Down, Left, Right.
   - W, A, S, D

2. Collect food to increase your score and make the snake grow longer.

3. Avoid colliding with the snake's body or the boundaries of the game area.

4. The game ends when the snake collides with itself or the boundaries.

5. Use the replay option to start a new game.
